FilChaP Tutorial 

Dear user, this tutorial aims at walking you through how to use FilChaP.
The tutorial data provided in this folder is PI proprietary, and cannot be used outside of the purpose of this tutorial.

This folder includes the following files/folders:

-- filament.txt : this is an example filament coordinate file with x (RA in pixels), 
		y (DEC in pixels) and z (velocity channel) coordinates. This is the exact filament
		used in Suri et al 2018, Figure 3.

-- tutorial.fits : this is a 3D fits file of the region on which the example filament is identified.

-- tutorial.peak.fits : this is a 2D peak intensity map of the map tutorial.fits. It is used for plotting only.

By running the example script ../RunFilchap.py one calculates filament properties based on the fits files and filament coordinates 
provided in this directory. The results are saved in:

-- ./plots : this is a directory where the resulting width calculation plots are saved.

-- ./results : this is a directory where the results are saved in text files.

You can visualize your results by using the following script.

-- createPandasDataframe.py : by using this script, you can write the results stored in text file into an hdf5 file.
				This format is much more easier to use with pandas dataframes.

-- plotResults.py : this script is an example of how the results can be visualizedi using pandas dataframes.
